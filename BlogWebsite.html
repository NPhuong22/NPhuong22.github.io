                <h3>Main dancerü™©</h3>
                <p> He was a strong candidate for the debut team, with exceptional stats and characteristics. His abilities were at the level of a cheat key, and even Park Moondae called him a monster. Even in a difficult group project, he managed to pull off a great performance by himself. His teammates, who were not as skilled, seemed to dance well because of him.</p>

                <h3>Cali-Kittyüé§</h3>
                <p>Cha Eugene has very noticeable fangs and often has a mischievous smile, hence why he is often compared to a cat or a tiger.
                  Cha Eugene is shown to be extremely energetic, straightforward, and very optimistic. He's pretty expressive and has a habit of whistling when he's in a good mood. <br><br>  He is part of the maknae line and is close with Kim Raebin, although they usually bicker, they care for each other as close friends.
                   He is a glutton and often hungry so when he is down on his feeling, it is easy for him to feel better when there is food around. Sometimes, he has trouble reading the atmosphere, but when push comes to shove, he can be quick to come up with solutions, as he's been shown to come up with clever ideas that bring unexpectedly great results.
